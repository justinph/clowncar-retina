clowncar-retina
===============

This builds upon the clown car tecnique put forth by [Estelle](https://github.com/estelle/clowncar) and [Smashing Magazine](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/02/clown-car-technique-solving-for-adaptive-images-in-responsive-web-design/).

Just other media queries (max-width, min-width, etc) it's possible to use `-webkit-max/max-device-pixel-ratio` and `min/max-resolution` to make the SVG 'retina' aware. 

See the [hard-coded demo page](http://justinph.github.io/clowncar-retina/) for a very simple example. The included php page uses a few helper functions to make outputting the URLencoded data-uri easier to mainuplate in development.
